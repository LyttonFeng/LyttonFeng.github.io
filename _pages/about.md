<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently an Associate Research Director at SenseTime Research, specializing in foundational large language models (LLMs), which powers [SenseChat](https://chat.sensetime.com/). As a core member of the LLM team, I am responsible for LLM post-training. Prior to this, I was the research leader of Remote Sensing Business Unit at SenseTime. My work focused on developing the foundational model for remote sensing interpretation, which was deployed as the base model for [SenseEarth](https://senseearth-cloud.com/). 


I received my PhD degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering at City University of Hong Kong. My supervisor was [Dr. Lai-Man PO](https://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/~lmpo/). My previous research focuses on two primary areas. The first involves learning from large-scale data, covering topics such as out-of-distribution generalization, semi-supervised learning, and webly supervised learning. The second focuses on models for general vision understanding tasks. My recent research interests focus on **LLM Reasoning and Agents**. I have published more than 20 papers in top AI conferences and journals, with a total of over 2,800 citations on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PnNAAasAAAAJ&hl=en).
